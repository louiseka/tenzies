## Description
### What is Tenzies?

Tenzies is a popular dice-rolling game. The goal of the game is to get all 10 of your dice to show the same number. 

### Technologies used
I have used React for this project as: 
- I was able to create reusable components for the dice
- I could manage and track the state of each die (whether its been held or matched other die)

It was also my first project using React useState and useEffect so it was good practice.

### Implementations for the future
- Display the number of rolls the player has taken on the screen.
- Show a timer so the player can track how long it took to get Tenzies.
- Save the player's time and/or roll count to local storage, allowing them to compete with their personal bests.
